    "The main benefits of padding are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It allows you to use a CONV layer without necessarily shrinking the height and width of the volumes. This is important for building deeper networks, since otherwise the height/width would shrink as you go to deeper layers. An important special case is the \"same\" convolution, in which the height/width is exactly preserved after one layer. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In modern deep learning frameworks, you only have to implement the forward pass, and the framework takes care of the backward pass, so most deep learning engineers don't need to bother with the details of the backward pass. The backward pass for convolutional networks is complicated. If you wish, you can work through this optional portion of the notebook to get a sense of what backprop in a convolutional network looks like. \n",
    "\n",
    "When in an earlier course you implemented a simple (fully connected) neural network, you used backpropagation to compute the derivatives with respect to the cost to update the parameters. Similarly, in convolutional neural networks you can calculate the derivatives with respect to the cost in order to update the parameters. The backprop equations are not trivial and we did not derive them in lecture, but we will briefly present them below.\n",

    "### 5.1 - Convolutional layer backward pass \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by implementing the backward pass for a CONV layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.1.1 - Computing dA:\n",
    "This is the formula for computing $dA$ with respect to the cost for a certain filter $W_c$ and a given training example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ dA += \\sum _{h=0} ^{n_H} \\sum_{w=0} ^{n_W} W_c \\times dZ_{hw} \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $W_c$ is a filter and $dZ_{hw}$ is a scalar corresponding to the gradient of the cost with respect to the output of the conv layer Z at the hth row and wth column (corresponding to the dot product taken at the ith stride left and jth stride down). Note that at each time, we multiply the the same filter $W_c$ by a different dZ when updating dA. We do so mainly because when computing the forward propagation, each filter is dotted and summed by a different a_slice. Therefore when computing the backprop for dA, we are just adding the gradients of all the a_slices. \n",
    "\n",
    "In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "da_prev_pad[vert_start:vert_end, horiz_start:horiz_end, :] += W[:,:,:,c] * dZ[i, h, w, c]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.1.2 - Computing dW:\n",
    "This is the formula for computing $dW_c$ ($dW_c$ is the derivative of one filter) with respect to the loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ dW_c  += \\sum _{h=0} ^{n_H} \\sum_{w=0} ^ {n_W} a_{slice} \\times dZ_{hw}  \\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $a_{slice}$ corresponds to the slice which was used to generate the activation $Z_{ij}$. Hence, this ends up giving us the gradient for $W$ with respect to that slice. Since it is the same $W$, we will just add up all such gradients to get $dW$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dW[:,:,:,c] += a_slice * dZ[i, h, w, c]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.1.3 - Computing db:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the formula for computing $db$ with respect to the cost for a certain filter $W_c$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ db = \\sum_h \\sum_w dZ_{hw} \\tag{3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have previously seen in basic neural networks, db is computed by summing $dZ$. In this case, you are just summing over all the gradients of the conv output (Z) with respect to the cost. \n",

    "In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:\n",

    "**Exercise**: Implement the `conv_backward` function below. You should sum over all the training examples, filters, heights, and widths. You should then compute the derivatives using formulas 1, 2 and 3 above. "
